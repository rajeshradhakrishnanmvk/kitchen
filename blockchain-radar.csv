solidity,Adopt,Programming Languages,FALSE,"<p>Fitness functions introduced by <a href=""/radar/techniques/evolutionary-architecture"">evolutionary architecture</a>, borrowed from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation#:%7E:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20evolutionary%20computation,soft%20computing%20studying%20these%20algorithms."">evolutionary computing</a>, are executable functions that inform us if our applications and architecture are objectively moving away from their desired characteristics. They're essentially tests that can be incorporated into our release pipelines. One of the major characteristics of an application is the freshness of its dependencies to other libraries, APIs or environmental components that a <strong>dependency drift fitness function</strong> tracks to flag the out-of-date dependencies that require updating. With the growing and maturing number of tools that detect dependency drifts, such as <a href=""/radar/tools/dependabot"">Dependabot</a> or <a href=""/radar/tools/snyk"">Snyk</a>, we can easily incorporate dependency drift fitness functions into our software release process to take timely action in keeping our application dependencies up to date.</p>"
javaScript,Trial,Programming Languages,FALSE,"<p>About a decade ago we introduced <a href=""/radar/techniques/continuous-delivery-cd"">continuous delivery (CD)</a>, our default way to deliver software solutions. Today's solutions increasingly include machine-learning models and we find them no exception in adopting continuous delivery practices. We call this <strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html"">continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML)</a></strong>. Although the principles of CD remain the same, the practices and tools to implement the end-to-end process of training, testing, deploying and monitoring models require some modifications. For example: version control must not only include code but also the data, the models and its parameters; the testing pyramid extends to include model bias, fairness and data and feature validation; the deployment process must consider how to promote and evaluate the performance of new models against current champion models. While the industry is celebrating the new buzzword of MLOps, we feel CD4ML is our holistic approach to implement an end-to-end process to reliably release and continuously improve machine-learning models, from idea to production.</p>"
python,Assess,Programming Languages,TRUE,"<p>One of the most nuanced decisions facing companies at the moment is the adoption of low-code or no-code platforms, that is, platforms that solve very specific problems in very limited domains. Many vendors are pushing aggressively into this space. The problems we see with these platforms typically relate to an inability to apply good engineering practices such as versioning. Testing too is typically really hard. However, we noticed some interesting new entrants to the market — including <a href=""https://www.honeycode.aws/"">Amazon Honeycode</a>, which makes it easy to create simple task or event management apps, and <a href=""https://parabola.io/"">Parabola</a> for IFTTT-like cloud workflows — which is why we're including <strong>bounded low-code platforms</strong> in this volume. Nevertheless, we remain deeply skeptical about their wider applicability since these tools, like Japanese Knotweed, have a knack of escaping their bounds and tangling everything together. That's why we still strongly advise caution in their adoption.</p>"
Rust,Assess,Programming Languages,TRUE,"<p>Credentials are everywhere in our lives and include passports, driver’s licenses and academic certificates. However, most digital credentials today are simple data records from information systems that are easy to modify and forge and often expose unnecessary information. In recent years, we've seen the continuous maturity of <strong>Verifiable Credentials</strong> solve this issue. The <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/"">W3C standard</a> defines it in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting and machine verifiable. The model puts credential holders at the center, which is similar to our experience when using physical credentials: users can put their verifiable credentials in their own digital wallets and show them to anyone at any time without the permission of the credentials’ issuer. This decentralized approach also enables users to better manage their own information and selectively disclose certain information and greatly improves data privacy protection. For example, powered by zero-knowledge proof technology, you can construct a verifiable credential to prove that you are an adult without revealing your birthday. The community has developed many <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/"">use cases</a> around verifiable credentials. We've implemented our own COVID health certification with reference to the <a href=""https://www.covidcreds.com/"">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a>. Although verifiable credentials don't rely on blockchain technology or <a href=""/radar/techniques/decentralized-identity"">decentralized identity</a>, this technique often works with DID in practice and uses blockchain as a verifiable data registry. Many decentralized identity frameworks are also embedded with verifiable credentials.</p>"

This means the pipelines can now be controlled by native Kubernetes clients (CLI or APIs) and can take advantage of underlying resource management features such as rollbacks. The pipeline declaration format is flexible and allows defining workflows with conditions, parallel execution paths and handling final tasks to clean up among other features. As a result, Tekton can support complex and hybrid deployment workflows with rollbacks, canary release and more. Tekton is open source and also offered as a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/tekton"">managed service by GCP</a>.

brownie,Hold,Frameworks & IDEs,FALSE,"<p>Technologies, especially wildly popular ones, have a tendency to be overused. What we're seeing at the moment is <strong>Node overload</strong>, a tendency to use Node.js indiscriminately or for the wrong reasons. Among these, two stand out in our opinion. Firstly, we frequently hear that Node.js should be used so that all programming can be done in one programming language. Our view remains that <a href=""/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming"">polyglot programming</a> is a better approach, and this still goes <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/javascript-as-a-first-class-language"">both ways</a>. Secondly, we often hear teams cite performance as a reason to choose Node.js. Although there are myriads of more or less sensible benchmarks, this perception is rooted in history. When Node.js became popular, it was the first major framework to embrace a nonblocking programming model which made it very efficient for IO-heavy tasks. (We mentioned this in our write-up of Node.js in 2012.) Due to its single-threaded nature, Node.js was never a good choice for compute-heavy workloads, though, and now that capable nonblocking frameworks also exist on other platforms — some with elegant, modern APIs — performance is no longer a reason to choose Node.js.</p>"
foundry/anvil,Adopt,Frameworks & IDEs,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://airflow.apache.org/"">Airflow</a></strong> remains our most widely used and favorite open-source workflow management tool for data-processing pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

dapp.tools,Trial,Tools,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""http://dapp.tools/"">dapp.tools</a></strong> is one of the principal libraries in Python for creating scientific plots and data visualizations that render in the browser via JavaScript. Such tools, compared to desktop tools that create static images, make it easy to reuse code for exploratory work in web applications. Bokeh is particularly good for this. The library is mature and full-featured. What we like about Bokeh: it's great at keeping to its concern as a presentation layer tool and not trying to take on concerns such as data aggregation (see <a href=""http://ggplot.yhathq.com/"">ggplot</a>) or web app development (such as <a href=""https://shiny.rstudio.com/"">Shiny</a> or <a href=""/radar/tools/dash"">Dash</a>). This makes it a joy to use when separation of concerns is important to you. Bokeh does provide web UI widgets and can run in server mode, but you can take or leave these features as you see fit. Bokeh is flexible, and it doesn't make too many assumptions about how you'll use it nor does it have many dependencies (such as <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/"">pandas</a> or notebooks).</p>"
